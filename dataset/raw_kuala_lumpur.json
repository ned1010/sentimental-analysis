Should have been offered in a menu. No Holy Book found too.\nBathroom glass door sliding mechanism is hazardous, harsh close could break it.\nLight switches are not 100% integrated, some lamps\u2019 switches are localized.\nAfter all, of course there are always room for improvement.\nLooking forward for the improvements in my next stay."

I\u2019ve always loved this hotel mainly due to its location and the comfortable stay. \nI stayed here during the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and just like any other hotels around the world, strict SOPs are implemented and must be adhered to - which is of course, why not. \nHowever, I am not sure why, the check-in process was terribly SLOW. I was only queuing behind 4 guests, but oh dear, it took about good 45-50 mins before it was my turn! Only 5 staffs were attending the check-in process. Apparently, guests MUST provide a copy of IC / passport for EACH and everyone staying in the rooms booked. Well, I do understand this is the rule anywhere, especially when you\u2019re a foreigner. But as a Malaysian, honestly, I HARDLY provide the details of my roomates, family members, etc. simply because it wasn\u2019t requested. Even if I booked a room (or 2-3 rooms) based on the ACTUAL pax staying, usually I was just asked to provide my IC and that\u2019s it. \nBut if it\u2019s the rule, okay I get it but I would highly suggest that Traders highlight this requirement upfront in their booking partners, or emails, or anything - because you know, people won\u2019t be queuing together with their 50 family members in one line for check-in obviously because it\u2019s a bit inconvenient and we\u2019re following the SOP and it\u2019s a mess, inconvenient and embarrassing to run around screaming asking for their ICs. There was this one guy, walking around asking for ICs in a loud volume, creating unnecessary panic and discomfort as if we are a thief checking in illegally into the hotel."

Once we\u2019ve paid and checked in, we were told that our room was not yet ready so we had to wait until being called. I would have appreciated had this been told before paying. It did feel like we were \u201ctricked\u201d. \nThe hotel prepared a waiting area just outside their ballroom for guests with my circumstance. They were kind enough to compensate with a drink station and some food - not for the famished though. If you\u2019ve got kids, it\u2019s an ample running area for them. \nAll in all, it took 2 hours from the moment we joined the check in queue to the point of getting a call informing our room was ready. I wasn\u2019t entirely happy but it was understandable given it being a weekend and people are staying local for a vacation. \nI appreciate & applaud the staffs behind the reception who managed to keep their composure, moving superbly fast (each guest took exactly 8 minutes to be checked in) and perseverance to endure some of the more emotional customers. So kudos to them!\nHowever a delayed checkin time not caused by the customer should be fairly compensated by more than a mere drink and mini food station. I hope the hotel could give more thoughts into this."

So I need to wait 1 hour but I'm ok with that. So I want to proceed with the payment first but I was shocked that I need to deposit RM500. I didn't have enough cash so I want to pay with my debit card. Unfortunately, the staff told me that the balance of the deposit (after room charges) will be refunded after 14 working days if paid through credit/debit card. Since I can't wait that long to receive my refund I have to walk away to the Pavilion searching ATM machine to cash out my money. All that process took me more than 1 hour and I'm able to enter the room at 2.45pm. This is outrageous and really stress me out during check-in. Hopefully hotel management can fix this. At Least let the customer know after they book the room so that the customer can prepare the cash. Thank you."

And then he went on about the shorts that my husband was wearing. for your information my husband was wearing a three-quarter shorts that he wears every single time we go swimming in a hotel. but the staff said that his three quarter shorts is not allowed. my husband said tried to explain that he is a religious Muslim so he has to wear shorts That is below the knee. The answer that the staff gave was very appalling. He said so you don't have to swim you can just sit on the side. Without any apology. That is not acceptable. We are in a Muslim country and you prohibit people to wear Muslim attire to swim. is there a policy written in black and white that says a three-quarter shorts is not allowed? If there is I would really want to see it. In fact I demand to see it. I have been to other hotels and this is not the first time we stay at a five-star hotel, but this is the first time that my husband was not allowed to swim because of his three-quarter shorts. Being in a Muslim country you should be aware of clothing that Muslims are allowed to when they go swimming. By denying us the swimming pool, that is just unfair. My opinion is, your hotel should be more aware of your surroundings and your location. you have probably never received this kind of complaints before I would understand, maybe you should start thinking about it because this is just ridiculous. you have to check your policy on your swimming dress code and please let me know if the three-quarter shorts is written on the policy saying that it is not allowed. That experience really charred my opinion of your hotel. You have the perfect location, the nicest room, the best front desk staff. So it is sad to see that this kind of situation still exist."

For breakfast we need to walk over to the 1st building.\n-Breakfast has various options, but all Asian style. For me as a European nothing to crave for. But I still got my tummy full.\n-We seem to were the only foreigners in Dorsett, the breakfast room were filled with local Malaysians, they all starred at us when we came into the breakfast room. My wife told me later that Dorsett is nowadays more a hotel that locals prefer.\n- swimming pool on the roof (level 30) is nice and big. My wife has worn a normal and proper swimsuit, which is allowed to wear in Malaysia. But the local family there went to the guard and complained about it. But the guard couldn\u2019t do anything because her swimsuit is proper, so the husband took out his 2 teeny children and they all left the pool area then. My wife and I then had the whole swimming pool for us alone. \n- The view to the twin towers is blocked by another building, you can only see the top of them.\n-TV: We had 3 TVs in our room, but only one was connected with a receiver box, the one in the living area. So the tv at the bed and in the bathroom (which bathtub) are useless. The receiver only has local language channels.\n- the interior inside the room is not the newest anymore, but it\u2019s still good and clean and not rundown. I rate the interior with 7 out of 10.\n-our room has soo many light switches, and every switch turns on a different light. So you really need to search by clicking several switches to find which light you are looking for.\n-tiny bathroom, but nice bathtub.\n- the sink (wash bowl) to wash your hands or clean your face is outside the bathroom. You wash your hands and brush your teeth nearby the bed."

We had to dragged our bags from the opposite parking and go on to the lobby to register and later to found out the building we are staying in is next door and again, no bell boy to help us out on the bags since we had kids to look out to as well. The front desk staff was not that helpful and informative when we first check in since we had mistakenly go on other people's room and later to find out that our room was on the next building...again we had to dragged the super heavy luggage along with our children.

We were there 10 minutes before 3pm. We were hungry bought food early thinking wanted to eat in the apartment but we end up waited for more than 40 minutes and only able to enter our apartment at 3.35pm. The check-in experience was really bad. They should have anticipated a heavy traffic due to festive season but it was so unfortunate. Customers have to be in queue for too long. They only have 3 counter to do both check in and check out. Too many customers were allowed to do late check out. Hence they have difficulty to get the apartment ready for next customer. For a two rooms apartment with no view (we can only see next building) for a price of RM700+, to me it is very expensive."

I could tell the hotel was full house looking at number of people checking in, probably it\u2019s the last weekend before Ramadan starts. Breakfast on our last day which is Sunday was full house, there was a line going into Lemon Garden. However the staff were very prompt and did their best to keep up to ensure customers don\u2019t have to wait too long for their tables. Room service was great too. Requests done from housekeeping also was very prompt. Oh ya, I went there to celebrate my daughter\u2019s 2nd birthday and they surprised us with a little birthday cake.

So i asked him \u201csince i bought the triple room price why do i need to pay more? Doesn\u2019t the price for triple included the 3rd bed already (extra bed)?\u201d He confidently said \u201cNo\u201d. I was so confused and ask him \u201cthen what did i get for triple room? It says x3 breakfast here, doesn\u2019t it supposed to be 3 beds too?\u201d And again he said \u201conly 2 beds and 3 breakfast\u201d. I\u2019ve been to many hotels and suites but never, ever any hotel I\u2019ve been before are like this. They usually very straightforward like price for dbl/twin room are for 2adt, thus 2bfast.. and price for triple room are for 3adt, thus the 3 bfast... Anyway when i about to pay again for extra bed (unwillingly and confused) the supervisor come to me and say i dont have to pay for extra bed.. \u201ccomplimentary from the hotel\u201d smiling, he said to me. I dont know what to feel but if this really how it works next time you guys need to put remark that \u201cTRIPLE ROOM ONLY HAVE 2 BEDS & 3 BFAST, EXTRA BED FOR 3RD PERSON IN THIS TRIPLE ROOM NEED TO BE PAID UPON CHECK-IN\u201d so other people wont get confused as i am.
