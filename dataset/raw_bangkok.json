They knew my name everywhere I went and were beyond helpful with everything I needed. \nMy room was phenomenal with incredible views from the 58th floor. The breakfast was perfect as it was ala carte but you could order as much as you wanted. Sitting poolside and with the lovely breeze every morning, it was a perfect place to start your day. Also, communicating on LINE was very helpful with the little questions or planning for the housekeepers to come in or a planned taxi that was needed.\nIf you want to treat yourself to a fantastic place to stay...Iebua at State Tower is a must stay!!"

Many other amazing skybars with music etc for alot less in Bangkok.I understand the hangover was filmed here but it was too pricey and empty may i add. It didn\u2019t feel like a bar as not many people went up there. Also upon arrival at check in they ask for a 10,000 baht deposit, if you give this in cash as i did u get it back on the day, card payments will take 5-7 days to be returned.

The suite was dated and lacked the facilities I expect from an hotel of this class - no modern conveniences (USB charging, functional WiFi, functional coffee) but I wonder if that was because we were a lower floor, superior suite. Having stayed at the Marina Bay Sands (my bar now for these establishments) Lebua State Tower drew short. \nBut hey, it was \u00a390 a night so what do we expect...\nWell, yes, that would be fair until you try to experience the Skybar. As residents we were still shuttled into the holding pen of Distil with the walk-in trade, and there was no option to skip the queue (as in MBS). For an iconic venue where people literally stay in the establishment for that caveat... I was a bit irritated by this. You buy a (grotesquely priced) cocktail and once finished you are ushered into the skybar (but only photos in certain spots please...). Walk in trade; fine I get that. It costs a lot to maintain an iconic venue and you can\u2019t lose out to opportunist selfie hunters, but your guests have already funnelled several hundred pounds into your tills... we\u2019d appreciate a little understanding for that. \nBut the markets the market. Lebua clearly aim their lower tier suites at basic travellers seeking a status symbol check in for a short stay. I raise my hand - I am that basic bitch. But at the same time, I could have halved my bill and stayed in the Marriott down the road. Instead I chose an iconic venue and feel a little taken-advantage-of. \nIf Lebua don\u2019t want riffraff like me than upgrade your rooms, triple your rates to Shangri-La levels, and charge me B1000 to come up the lift and take a photo on the terrace."

However - try find a menu and pricing - it\u00b4s nigh impossible. So we followed dress code rules etc, which is no problem at all and asked to go for a drink at the famed Sky Bar on one evening of our stay.\nWe were whisked up to the top floor, only to then be dropped two floors down and taken to their Pink Champagne Bar - where we were led to a table & pressed repeatedly to stay and enjoy the view there. We said over & over no thanks & left the Pink Bar asking again to be taken to the Sky bar. So we go up again, and then are led YET again into another bar - this time the Whisky bar. Again NOT where we wanted to be. At this point we had a menu shoved in our face and we were told that ONLY if we order a drink at this bar we could go to the Sky Bar. WHAT?\nSo we left - disgruntled to say the least. Before going back down, I managed to enter Scirocco and the Sky Bar area - but after having been shoved and pushed around - where the aim was definitely to force you to order OVER priced drinks at numerous bars before giving you what you want - we decided against eating at their restaurant the next night and left feeling rather disgusted at the service. \nWe were paying to be in the hotel - we were not riff raff off the street. \nThe sneakiness of also not allowing guests to see the menu before making a reservation at the restaurants (for which you must also pay a deposit - even if you are already a hotel guest who has ALREADY paid a deposit on check in of 10,000 Baht) - is also rude. I struggle to understand why they would not publish their menus and pricing - would they rather embarrass their guests when they realise that dinner may cost more than they realise? \nI have been to many Chefs Table and fine dining restaurants - & never been treated this way."

And I asked them for the second time why is the extra deposit ! They said it's just to guarantee their money... Would you imagine ! And another staff spoke to me on the phone said that I have to deposit 5,000 at least to accept my laundry otherwise they will not accept my cloths to be washed ! Wow ! ... In the end the manager came to my room and apologized to what happened he said the hotel was not clear about this thing and he just started to work in this hotel it's been around 3 months and the reason why he came because I requested him. By the way the laundry bill reached approximately 18,000 Baht when I checked out and it's been paid without any problems, but this time what happened during my stay was weird, strange... Ah let's not forget, the TV is not smart and small + the shower of the bathroom has to be covered by curtain to prevent water spreading."

It made us feel like criminals. Check in was more focused on money and processes rather than making you feel welcome. I had pre contacted about a late check out and on arrival they could only extend to maximum of 1pm, I offered to pay more but not possible !! annoying as we had a late flight. Also the walk from the BST was quite long through the mall with rucksacks. When you get to the hotel they call a bell boy to carry the last bit to your room. Would have paid to have bell boy met you at entrance to mall. When we left we got a taxi to aiport for 500 baht much easier."

So if you're staying 1 week, you're paying fully in advance and then also having a 14,000 baht hold on your credit card. I think thats a ridiculous policy, given that it can take 3 weeks for that money to release on your card. I tried to discuss it with the front office manager but I found her to be a rude arrogant woman. I explained all other 5 star hotels I've been too don't operate this way. I tried to ask for the hotel manager, she tried to claim she's the hotel manager. Not so, since I met the hotel manager a few days earlier (a foreigner).\nThe fire alarm went off in the middle of the night across the entire hotel. So the lobby was full of people. That's where I met the hotel manager mentioned above as he came in from home. He said it's a malfunction and I noticed they had to kill the system for a day or two as the red light wasn't flashing on the smoke detector.\nThey have a silly policy of not allowing grab or foodpanda riders to simply ride up to the front of the hotel to deliver food. Security force them to go around the back of the hotel through boom gates, get a parking card, and all this rubbish. Completely unnecessary and confusing for the riders and the guests.\nThey claim the restaurant is open 24 hours for room service. In actual fact the restaurant closes at 9pm and if you order food after 9pm you can only choose from the \"night menu\" which has about 5 things on it. No Thai food whatsoever. Only Burgers, pasta, that type of stuff. The stuff an assistant can heat in the microwave."

Not a big problem but I expect to have that part of a service mind. The scrambled eggs came out cold though. The Cesar salad dressing was way too sour. You may be asking well I did finish the food, yes because I was hungry. One of the waiters serving water spilled some water on my table without apologising and rushing away. Anyways breakfast this time is not so good - the quality and the service. On Saturday night, I honestly expected a lot for the cooling tower. Unfortunately the location of the seats are just ridiculous especially a long sofa in which it should be facing the view outside not inside facing other guests. Didn't like the mojito ordered - i should have told the bartender but it's ok not a big deal. The staff was good though - very attentive thank you!"

Our one night stay was prepaid so we were taken aback on arrival by the demand for a credit card deposit of 1000 TB - something about a mini bar guarantee. We felt like clients at the service counter of a low-cost car hire company rather than at the desk of a four star hotel. We protested and after some time the people on the desk relented. We had similar feelings when we asked for a late checkout. This was kindly granted at half the rate of a full booking. We were ok with that arrangment. When I noted the half day rate I was quoted was more than than half what we had paid for the room we were told that the hotel was using the rate for the day. But when I (immediately) compared this rate to Booking.com rate for the day I was surprised to learn the rate quoted was actually higher that the Booking.com rate. We decided to leave things be."

It so happened the hotel had a promotion, however, and we ended up having to only pay 400 THB each, whereas the normal price is a whopping (but well worth it) price of 800 THB. So ... my main complaint would be that the Sheraton is a bit on the pricey side ... but well within the norm for this class of hotel in Bangkok, especially given its location directly on the main river."

The water taxis are easily accessible and good value to get to the Royal Palace. Do not overlook the happy hour (think it was 6-8pm) and other options which make a drink decent value. Also the breakfast is a really good option and by sheer volume alone will keep you going all day and work out cheaper than anywhere nearby. I'd definitely recommend the hotel to others."

Super convenient for visits to Grand Palace, Temple of Emerald Bhudda, Wat Arun, Khaosan Road and more. \nBreakfast is fantastic, the buffet is huge but make sure you're there before closing. On our first day we went down a bit later than normal due to being tired from traveling and by the time we'd sat down with an omelette they were clearing away so when they say breakfast ends at 10/1030, they really mean it. If you like to have a few breakfast rounds, I'd say leave an hour! \nThe gym is great, we used it quite late in the evenings and it was empty (joys of jetlag). For a hotel gym it is very well equipped with a number of different resistance machines as well as mix of weights and a Smith machine. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice. \nWe ate in Thara Thong one night and it was delicious but MEGA expensive. We'd only just arrived in Thailand as this was our first stop and had we been out and about we probably would have realised how expensive it was in comparison to out and about but the service was great, the restaurant has a lovely authentic feel to it that we didn't get anywhere else."

Lighting was good and the place was very conducive for work meetings. \nFood wise - it was crazy at the goji. Make sure you set aside about an hour or more for breakfast because the spread is just crazy good. \nLocation - situated just about 10 mins from the BTS station and beside a park. Bring a pair of shoe along to have a run in the morning. Loads of runners. It was super Easy to get around as the BTS is well connected. Convenience stores are just outside the hotel so you can get food at anytime of the day. Food is also readily available around the area. \nThe whole stay was extremely pleasant except for one issue with the shower door which had water leaking to the bathroom floor. I travelled with my kids this and I felt unsafe for them to be walking on wet floors. \nI highlighted to the staff and they came very very promptly and tried to fix the problem. I told them we are going out soon and they said they will reply us ASAP and do something about it. \nWhen we returned to the hotel, we spoke to the duty manager, Rachel, who explained to us that the rubber seal was not good for the bathroom door and was extremely apologetic that we had to switch rooms that night itself. She was so apologetic that she gave us a mini upgrade to the toilet with a smaller bathtub and also gifted the family complimentary breakfast at the goji. *this is a compliment to the Rachel and team for trying to solve the problem ASAP without inconveniencing us. \nThank you Marriott for ensuring we had a very good stay."

The signal and channels from the TV in the room is out of service and the technician just gave us Thai local channels. Wifi was a bit slow at the 11th floor. The free breakfast was not satisfying also and was served plain and dull, due to covid19 I wished it would have been a buffet breakfast instead of the staff serving it plain and not delicious. Breakfast not recommended. Housekeeping Staff needs to be more friendly and helpful."

I let him know that I was. He then passed my door without opening it as he had intended to do in the first place but then noticed that I am black and decided to skip it. Don't worry, I called him back to open the door. They also sent the cleaner to my room while I was getting ready to leave to ask me if I was checking out. I didn't understand why. When I said something to the front desk girl about it she raised her voice at me, pretty much the ultimate in rudeness in Thai culture. I would say customer service is hit or miss. Cleanliness could have been better as well. There was a stain that looked like blood on the floor and cabinet of the bathroom in the first room they put me in and a white creamy stain appeared on the door while I was showering in the second."

The solution the manage given was...to take note on my card number on the paper. I personally do not feel that comfortable to give away my card number to someone else. It is very unprofessional to come up with this solution. If your system is not ready, yet, please have a back-up solution for this. Not push the customer to give away their card number."

It didn\u2019t come from the toilet because it smells fine nor the living room and the other room. It\u2019s not too strong but you can sometimes smell it, which was annoying if you\u2019ve settled in already."
