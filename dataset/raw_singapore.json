I totally forget to request for smoking room and upon check in it slip out of my mind to request also due to the stuning view at the lobby and 5 star reception service you guys provided. When when enter the room then i just remember about smoking room. I called the reception isit to late to request the smoking room ? They polite answer and get back to me. Next moment i received a bell that a bellboy came to ask are we ready to view the smoking room. I was suprise with the fast service. \nThen i recommend my friends about carlton and came back second time and thier review is the same as mine and they also feel like carlton is a best place to staycay and don\u2019t mind coming back."

Housekeeping staff was good and quick at doing their work. They know what they are doing and always asked if I needed anything before they left. Very professional and passionate, good job! When I checked-out, the staff went person-to-person and helped us. It speeds up the check out process and I like it!\nLocation: Very convenient!

I ordered breakfast for my last morning there and wanted to pay. It turned out that there was something else from the day before. I told the staff that I didn\u2019t order in the bill but he insisted that is from my room. I told him, then please show me my signature of receiving that good. He could find it and spent more than 15 minutes of trying to call restaurant session. Once he realised that it took too much time already then he said \u201cI can\u2019t reach my colleague, so I will just charge you if I get a prove that you didn\u2019t order that, I will call you and we will make a refund.\u201d \nSo I said \u201cno, you just need to find that order paper that I wrote and sign, I won\u2019t go back and forth for this amount of money. I won\u2019t pay for taxi back and forth to settle the bill and get a refund of I didn\u2019t order and eat. Then the person disappeared to another office for awhile and come back with new bill.\nMy breakfast cost a lot more than what he tried to charge me. Why he doesn\u2019t believe the customer especially when he can\u2019t find the evidence to show. Sadly it happened at last step, it ruined my feelings and the feeling toward Carlton hotel."

But what I would recommend is to upgrade to the toilet bowl bidget which would be much more easier.\n2) Is the washing\\drying machine, washing part no problem, but the drying part took more then 5hrs and it is still not dry. Expected our luggage to be light same during check in, but checking out with the damp clothes which really made a huge different, luggage become more heavier. I did check the dryer, and it need to be maintain. Need to clear all those dust which block the air flow. Due to the amount of dust, the dryer can't dry the clothes. Will need to clean everyday during housekeeping."

I was informed by manager that 3rd party booking sites usually charge only for 2 persons(eventhough it was a room for 4 adults) I was further advised that in future to book direct via their own website. So i went ahead to confirm these details on their website which then showed the room details n pricing for 4 adults were exactly the same as paid on bookings.com. It clearly stated as well that price already included additional 2guests.

However there was a single chair in the room. So staying in the room was not possible unless you are in bed. The room had no table for dining in, they at least were very helpful in bringing some chairs from their conference room for dinning in. \nAlso the furniture in the balcony is fancy but not comfortable. So we did not realy have a nice place to lounge close to the plunge pool. The furniture mattress also does not dry properly so it has a strange unpleasant smell. They should replace it by the very comfortable lounge chair they have around the pool. Also I would suggest that they take out the useless empty plant pot outside and place instead a table and 2 chairs close to the pool like they have in the other rooms. When you book such a room specially in these times you really want to enjoy it. If it was not for this our stay would have been perfect as the hotel rally delivers in all other aspects."

We understand that we couldn't do late check out but we just tried our luck with reason. The staff who was on the phone just hang up just after telling us that we couldn't It's just quite unpleasant. \nUnderstand that the hotel is full and all staff are very busy with end meets.

We rode in on our little scooter anyway and found out that parking for scooter was free and right next to the hotel lobby. Not sure if this was just a simple lapse in the staff knowledge or perhaps parking was something out of the hotel's control. \nThe rooms did not provide shavers unless requested for, and there was no extra roll of toilet paper. The rain shower was great! but unfortunately every time we opened the glass door of the shower, the top of the glass door would scrap against the rain shower head. I honestly thought it was going to give way at some point. The seal for the shower door was not done very well/ had come loose so the toilet bowl area would get wet whenever we showered. \nRoom can be a little dark at times even in the middle of the day, perhaps due to location of our room. Lights in the room were towards the yellow hue so its not the best place to get work done in.\nWifi was free but don't expect good continuous fast connection. Although I appreciated the nice touch of airplay and chromecast on their smart tv, the connection broke up a few times through one episode of 45mins so that was quite aggravating.\nHad dinner one of the nights at Butterflies and Beast -- Ordered the Nasi goreng, half portion of pork knuckle and chicken claypot rice. The pork knuckle was good! Claypot rice is reasonable, and the nasi goreng was dismal (chicken wings tasted like it came out from macdonald's mcwings box, fried rice was blend and satay meat were very small dices of chicken. Acar was okay). You can get better claypot rice and nasi goreng in the nearby eateries in chinatown or kampung glam/bugis for a fraction of the price and double the happiness. I will not go back to BnB again although their service was good."

The hotel staff was thin - may be likely due to COVID-19, but we couldnt see more than 1 person in the lobby for asking for directions/otherwise for asking normal questions about resort. \nThe greeting while checking in for the hotel was almost missing. So, didnt feel any warmth from hotel while checking in. \nThe kids playroom could use some more small additions. By and large there was a big slide and a small slide, but could use some more additions. However, the staff was trying to keep kids engaged with hide and seek within the slide, so atleast they were engaged. \nThe hotel entrance is like 200 meters away from the nearest siloso beach bus stop. However, those 200 meters are uphill, it would be nice if hotel can have a buggy person present to take old people, kids and pregnant women up to the entrance while coming back to hotel after spending tiring day outside."

But still, we added water and nothing happened. Restricted time only 1 hour, not enough to paint finish. Total waste of money and time.\nRestaurant has dress code policy (no swimsuit). But this is a beach resort (?!?). We were hungry and were asked to get dressed first before dine in, but we still want to go to the pool afterwards. So at the end needed to shower, get dressed, eat breakfast then change to swimsuit again. There was a \u201cbeach bar\u201d with no dress code but they didn\u2019t sell food.

I could smell the fumes from cooking in other rooms in my room\nThe service I feel, though good and friendly, lacked true hospitality and warmth. I had to extend my stay from 3 to 4 weeks. I was told by reception that occupancy was very high, it was not possible to extend beyond 3 days, and a higher rack-rate would be charged per night. And that as there were also no other room types available I should look for solutions elsewhere\nI subsequently found another (smaller) room in the same property on Booking.com. I was told by reception that as occupancy was high, that staff that I must check-out of the existing room at noon, and check-in for the new room again after 15:00. In between they could store my luggage\nI understand and did not expect bend-over-backwards efforts to accommodate my extension. I fully understand I must vacate my room by noon to allow it to be cleaned and turned around for the next guest. I appreciate that I can only check in to my new room not before 15:00 as the room needs to be turned around after the last guest.\nWhat is did not appreciate are the following:\n(1) to be reminded 4 hours before I am due to vacate the room that I have to do so, and that my newly assigned room will not be available before 15:00, and that I should start to pack. Bearing in mind there has to be obviously a little tiny bit of buffer between me and the next guest because theoretically I could have extended my stay by 3 days\n(2) the cold language (or what I perceive as cold)\nThese \u2018services\u2019 and experience made me feel like the most unwanted guest, that I am not welcomed at the Citadines Balestier.\nMy needs and demands were minimal during my stay. Beyond check-in, asking if there was a possibility to extend my stay, and check-out, I had not had to trouble the reception staff. My room was always kept tidy as a manner of respect to the housekeeping staff. I had no opportunity to use the other hotel facilities."

Unfortunately it was still loud for the neighbours and 2 hotel staff came up to request to keep the noise level lower, which we gladly obliged and understood why. At this time, staff acknowledged that the noise was no longer an issue but he wanted our guests to leave immediately. We explained we had ordered food and both guests would leave once done, but was asked to give a specific timing. When we requested for time for food to arrive and to finish the meal (01:05-02:30), he said he would come back at 01:30 and then haggled for 02:00. I don\u2019t quite understand the need to be so pushy especially when I had made it known that my guests were definitely not staying overnight and had only joined us for a birthday celebration. Extremely unnecessary and spoiled our last night\u2019s stay. Definitely felt it could have been handled much better."

What's worse is next day we came back to my key cards unable to read in the lift. After awhile it worked but then got stuck outside of my room. We called reception and they were asking series of questions and so on. One of it was if we had guests, our age and my name? Well ridiculous but I complied. I suspect the staff(s) thought we're the ones making the noises I think. As it make sense, cards not working and all of the questions. Then after the staff gave us our new working card, he waited outside for a minute before moving off. When we left our room in the afternoon, we did not request for room service though but our room was already made. Luckily we brought along most our valuables and belongings. 'Most' as my girlfriend left her laptop. So I guess it was just inappropriate to assume we're not of age when we gave our identity when checking-in and thinking we're the ones who made the noises when the real culprit gets away. And the air-con was not working I think as I've set it to the lowest but it doesn't seem to get cold. Not a negative feedback though, just letting you know what I experience as it's not my first time being here and would love to come back in near future."

There was a patio onto the garden which was nice but no chairs to sit on outside so I\u2019m not sure what the point of it was. We were moved quickly to another room with a sea view which was great but the tv didn\u2019t work, still no chairs on the balcony and lots of the fixtures were rusted and old.

The AC leaked and made the floor slippery (my son felt before going to bed, that's how we realized) and we had the engineering team coming in at 10pm to vacuum the excess condensation in the system, it was extremely noisy and not particularly clean operation. We filled a formal complaints during our checkout the next day but as of writing of this feedback (7 days later) we haven't heard back! Given the water infiltration marks this is clearly not a new issue (at least in the room we got) and for the price we paid we would have expected better."

We arrived to the exquisite colonial atmosphere of the beautiful hotel and were warmly escorted to a room of equal splendour. There were balloons and a slice of cake with compliments from the hotel. Throughout our stay, we were snugly looked after by all of the hotel staff. We would like to personally thank the Fullerton's Duty Manager during our stay, Justin. He definitely put our comfort and satisfaction as a top priority. His professionalism and hospitality made our stay at the Fullerton a truly memorable experience. \nOne of the highlights of our stay is the iconic view of the Singapore skyline from our room, mainly made possible by the Fullerton's impeccable location.\nNevertheless, it is the warmness and the little surprises offered by the staff during our stay that won our hearts!"

Its pretty challenging to get into a lift when you are either on the 3rd floor or 5th floor. Its also quite annoying that the reception is on the 3rd floor and the concierge in on ground floor. Please work out a more reasonable layout for your Guest convenience. And the lift are pretty small."

Great views at Mr Stork though, and again very friendly wait staff. \nBreakfast was so-so. My partner had the laksa which lacked the usual richness from the coconut broth you would expect from the dish, so it ended up just tasting like chili soup. I had the eggs benedict, which I have no complaints about. But with so many choices around the hotel, it's probably a better option to explore those instead."

Food wasn't exactly fantastic and both days were the same.\nWe asked room service for ice and they said it would be $5! Never had to pay for ice in any other 5 star hotel before. \nPool system was a bit weird. We can't book in advance and have to walk in. BUT if we go down and it's full, then we can stand by for slots. So it is like a wasted trip down as pool is nearly always full. Rather we call in and book a slot in advance and go down for it.\nWill be good if hotel entertainment can be updated and include streaming services on smart TVs (Netflix amazon prime etc) as the TV channels selection is quite dismal.\nHotel is not exactly \ud83e\uddd2-friendly which is not necessarily a bad thing but parents would def appreciate gestures such as toiletries for kids, kids play kit (esp at breakfast). Even the cot came without linen (we had to ask for it)."
